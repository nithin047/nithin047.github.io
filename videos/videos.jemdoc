J. R. R. Tolkien recites the Lament of Boromir. I find this poem/song quite haunting in the context of Boromir's and Denethor's tragic arcs in LoTR. Boromir's fall to the One Ring's corruption and redemption are at the forefront of these lyrics. Tolkien also has a wonderful voice. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EF9Wh_Q7lU& (link)]. Clamavi de Profundis has an excellent [https://open.spotify.com/track/3UfKlvfwOcGgkaFvNfBVak?si=46a00c41979d4b98 version] set to music.
