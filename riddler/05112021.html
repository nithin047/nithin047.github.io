<h2>Riddler Express</h2>
<p>
This is an interesting problem - it immediately seems related to the concept in social networks that says &lsquo;your friends are more likely to have more friends than you&rsquo;, since you're more likely to be connected to well-connected people. Let's see if my hunch plays out.<br /><br />

We want to calculate the expected number of friends any one of Marcia's friends has. Since everything in this problem is symmetric, <i>all</i> of Marcia's friends have the same expected number of friends. Let's consider one of her friends, who we'll name Perrin. Perrin has at least one friend (Marcia) and 99 other potential friends. <br /><br /> Since all friendships are i.i.d, Perrin has \(1 + \frac{99}{2} = \mathbf{50.5}\) friends on average. <br /><br />
Note that this is larger than Marcia's expected number of friends, which is \(\mathbf{50}\). This isn't really because Marcia is more likely to be connected to well-connected people &ndash; more that we're conditioning on the existence of <i>at least one</i> friend for Perrin.

<h2>Riddler Classic </h2>
<p>
It seems as if the most straightforward way to do this is to write a program to look for such numbers. Solving this analytically seems like it will require a grasp of number theory far beyond my own. <br /><br />


This is straightforward to code (<a href="https://github.com/nithin047/riddler/blob/master/07112021/find_numbers.py" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>here</a> is my script) and after \(36\), the first such number is \(\mathbf{378}\). For extra credit, the next two are \(\mathbf{3906}\) and \(\mathbf{49600}\).</p>
