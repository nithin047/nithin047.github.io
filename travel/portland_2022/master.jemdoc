= Day 1 (May 7)

Started exploring the city today. The most immediate thing that I notice is that the PNW is so much more \it{lush} than Texas. Texas lawn is scrawny and sparse, PNW lawn is dense and tall and strong. It's cool and wet here, and temperate plants are THRIVING. There's also moss everywhere and that's cool. Trees are TALL. Started the day (Jay left for AAI 2022 early) at Twisted Croissant, who have a beautiful collection of quirky croissant variations. I had a savory croissant with black truffle bechamel and mushrooms on top -- earthy from the double-fungi hit, creamy from the bechamel and oh my god the layers on that thing were shatteringly crisp. Next I stopped at Saint Simon Coffee Co., which was highly recommended by our AirBnB host. I got a cardamom latte because cardamom, and it was good. Last I stopped at helen bernards bakery, where I picked up a cinnamon roll (excellent -- soft, moist, very cinnamon-y, the gold standard for CRs) and a percan brittle rolled around PB french cream (!). After some planning, I decided to go to the International Rose Test Garden. I used public transport (bus and light rail onwards, tram and bus on the way back) -- quite convenient but I wouldn't go so far as to say that cars aren't necessary in Portland. Definitely less necessary than in Austin tho. I got to the Rose Garden, only to discover that it was contained within Washington Park: >458 acres of mostly forest, which also contains the Oregon Zoo, an arboretum and a Holocaust and Vietnam memorial! I spent some time walking there, and I LOVED the experience. Something about the type of vegetation that was there, combined with the weather (it's been drizzling/raining). Petrichor in the air, the new-leaf green everywhere...

I visited the Holocaust memorial and then was pleasantly surprised to find out that there's a free shuttle service that runs throughout the park, which I promptly used to get to the rose garden. A harsh winter unfortunately meant that no flowers had appeared yet. Right opposite though, was the Japanese Garden. Ticket guy was from Austin and lived off Burnet! It was a collaboration between the cities of Portland and Sapporo, in an attempt to heal the rifts caused by WWII. It was absolutely beautiful, and very peaceful. I watched an ikebana demonstration there and there is certainly an art and science to it. Caught the shuttle, bus and tram back to the AirBnB, and went to Sudra (a vegan Indian-Southern American restaurant on E Burnside) for a (very) late lunch. I got the Masala Film (a mocktail of mango, lime, and ginger where the mango was a bit absent -- the drink was delightfully ginger-forward) and a Indo-Chinese Plate (chick'n manchurian with noodles, good). Stopped at an amazing ice cream shop called 50 Licks (flavors as quirky as Austin's Licks) and had 2 mini-scoops (delightful concept) of their Oregon Strawberry and French Toast flavors. Picked up Jay from the convention center and off we went to Powell's, but not before stopping at a refreshingly unpretentious burger joint called Little Big Burger for some truffle fries. Jay was hungry so we spent only a little while at Powell's BUT IT'S SO BIG AND COOL. Finally went to a Sri Lankan vegan place called Mirisata, where we got a kotthu parotta plate (they gave us large instead of small), some unimpressive potato curry and a free curry plate because the kitchen made extra?? the curry plate was very good, especially their seeni sambol and jackfruit. I've always had the dried jarred seeni sambol, so the wetter fresh version was a revelation. We have way too much leftovers.
